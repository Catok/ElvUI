[b]Additions:[/b]
*Nameplates will now attempt to display castbars on non-targeted units.
*Add option to the Reminders module to toggle strict filters. Having this option off will allow you to use the Reminders module for spells that aren't in your spellbook. I.E: Spell Proc's.
*Add button in the reminders module to toggle Show/Hide of your reminder icon.
*Add option to the Reminders module to set the xOffset of the icon.
*Add option to the Reminders module to set the yOffset of the icon.

[b]Fixes:[/b]
*Fix graphical issue on some Next/Previous button skins.
*Raid Debuff module was not using a filter and displaying all icons. This was caused when I attempted to fix a lua error a while ago.
*Fix issue with having the portrait overlay option turned on was causing the incoming heals to not display for the player and target frames.
